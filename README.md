# Fluent pattern

 This provides an easily readable and flowing API by chaining method calls, often referred to as method chaining. This approach 
 is ideal for building complex objects step-by-step and improving the overall developer experience.

 Usually the developer should be mindful about the parameters which needs to be added while creating an object.
 Sometimes forgetting to add any required fields may cause issues as well in a business journey.

 Fluent pattern will provide a step by step chaining of required fields, where the developer will be forced to add whatever is 
 needed to intialize.
